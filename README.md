# GL_CV_Botanical_Research

This project uses computer vision techniques to classify plant species from images.  It's part of a Great Learning assignment.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a classifier that can identify the species of a plant from a photo.  The dataset used contains images of 12 different plant species.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Satya0-0/GL_CV_Botanical_Research.git`
2. Install the required libraries:  (List the key libraries, e.g., `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow opencv-python Pillow`)
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook GL_CV_Botanical_Research.ipynb`

## Files

*   `GL_CV_Botanical_Research.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
*   `data/`: Data set used: "17 category dataset" from URL - https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/

## Results

The CNN model achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of around 54% on the test set.
